## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Scaffolding** (#1): initial project skeleton — `pyproject.toml` with uv/hatchling,
  multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` with `onboarding` and `dashboard`
  services, `.env.example`, Alembic config with an empty migrations directory,
  source package tree (`src/zotai/{s1,s2,s2/dashboard,api,utils}`), test harness
  (`tests/conftest.py`, per-subsystem test packages), config templates
  (`config/{taxonomy,feeds,scoring}.yaml`, feeds all `active: false`),
  `scripts/healthcheck.py`, MIT `LICENSE`.

### Changed

- **Spec**: `docs/plan_02_subsystem2.md` §10 — replaced the single-line PDF
  fetch priority (which excluded Sci-Hub as "illegal") with an explicit
  six-source cascade: OpenAlex OA URL → DOI resolver → Anna's Archive →
  Library Genesis → Sci-Hub → RSS URL. Each source is toggleable via
  `S2_PDF_SOURCES`. Rationale: the tool is local and personal, and the
  target audience relies on these services as standard fallbacks when
  institutional access falls short. Issue #16.
